## Module 5 Project

In this project, an employee directory has been created to share the contacts of 12 random employees from the fictional company called Awesome Startup.
The app provides a gallery displaying all 12 employees and it allows you to search for a particular employee, as well as click on their user card for more information in which a modal window will appear.
I've used the Random User Generator API (https://randomuser.me/) to display the employees information.

### Personal style changes to the project include:
* Changed the body background colour.
* Made the h1 header a larger font size.
* Changed the modal window background colour.
* Changed the modal text colour.
* Added a box shadow on the user cards when hovering over them.
